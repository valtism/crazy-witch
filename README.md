Solving the Crazy Witch puzzle

Crazy witch is a puzzle with a simple rule, and a frustratingly difficult solution. The player is given 9 pieces with coloured witch heads and tails, and is asked to match them in a way that each witch is completed in their own colour. The box says there are 2 solutions, and I figured that doing this programmatically would be a lot more fun then shuffling tiles around for hours.

This program finds both solutions in ~2.4s on my local machine. I'm sure this can be optimised.
